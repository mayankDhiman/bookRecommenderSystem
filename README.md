# bookRecommenderSystem
This is a basic Book Recommender System written in Python (*.ipynb). 
+The data set used can be fetched from here [here](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/)
+Right now it calculates covariance of a particular book with other books (_as a measure of similarity_).
+Books having highest values of covariance are outputted

### Future improvements: 
+It can be integrated in a web based social network for book readers. Where users will be able to get best
suggestions for their next read!
